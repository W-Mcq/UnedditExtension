<h2>Uneddit Reddit</h2>
<p>
Based on the service set up at <a href="http://unedditreddit.com/" target="_blank">Uneddit Reddit</a>, 
I've developed a Chrome extension that uses the data, but extends the functionality. This service captures
original comments from <a href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, allowing the Uneddit Reddit extension
to replace the comments in line with the original text.
</p><p>
This service was put into place a couple of years ago, and then Reddit asked it be shut down. It's back, but it's unknown
for how long. I essentially wrote this because I didn't like having my Chrome toolbar in view, and I also wanted to try my hand
at writing a Chrome extension. So, here it is.
</p><p>
To install, simply click the download link to the left, or <a href="package/UnedditExtension.crx">here</a>, open a tab to <code>chrome://extensions</code>, and drag it from your download bar onto the Extensions page.
