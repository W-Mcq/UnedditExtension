        <h3>Uneddit Reddit</h3>
	<p>
	Based on the service set up at <a href="http://unedditreddit.com/" target="_blank">Uneddit Reddit</a>, 
	I've developed a Chrome extension that uses the data, but extends the functionality. This service captures
	original comments from <a href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, allowing the Uneddit Reddit extension
	to replace the comments in line with the original text.
	</p><p>
	This service was put into place a couple of years ago, and then Reddit asked it be shut down. It's back, but it's unknown
	for how long. I essentially wrote this because I didn't like having my Chrome toolbar in view, and I also wanted to try my hand
	at writing a Chrome extension. So, here it is.
	</p><p>
	To install, simply click the download link to the left, or <a href="package/UnedditExtension.crx">here</a>, open a tab to <code>chrome://extensions</code>, and drag it from your download bar onto the Extensions page.
