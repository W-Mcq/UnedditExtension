**Now featuring Uneddit Reddit**

Today, Uneddit Reddit has now shows up in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uneddit-reddit/akibhpdlinfcelalimeibjcdolmfifel). This should make things much easier from an installation perspective.

You can also see on the sidebar to the left, there's an "Add to Chrome" button. Just click it, and the extension installs! Enjoy!
