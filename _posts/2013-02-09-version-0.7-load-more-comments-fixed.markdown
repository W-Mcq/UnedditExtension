title: Version 0.7 Load More Comments Fixed
---
Just wanted to let you all know that the Uneddit Reddit extension has just hit version 0.7. You can get it in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uneddit-reddit/akibhpdlinfcelalimeibjcdolmfifel) or if you already have it installed, through your Extensions page (hit Update Extensions Now).

This version fixes the issue where it would not let you undelete comments that were loaded through the "load more comments" link.
