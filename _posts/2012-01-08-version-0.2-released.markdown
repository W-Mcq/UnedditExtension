# Version 0.2 Released #  
## Security Fix and Auto-Updating ##

The Uneddit Reddit Extension got a bug fix today, with version 2.0. The issue was with injecting HTML directly from the JSON data returned from [Uneddit Reddit](http://unedditreddit.com).

Additionally, with this update, I finally figured out auto-updating. So, for this update, you'll have to [download it manually](/UnedditExtension/package/UnedditExtension.crx) and then install it. After this one, it will automagically update. Sorry about not including that on the first go around. I didn't realize I had to do something beyond the `homepage_url` flag in the `manifest.json` file.
