title: Version 0.5 Released: Language Issue Fixed
---
Just wanted to let you all know that the Uneddit Reddit extension has just hit version 0.5. You can get it in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uneddit-reddit/akibhpdlinfcelalimeibjcdolmfifel) or if you already have it installed, through your Extensions page (hit Update Extensions Now).

This version was pushed out to fix the error that it would not work on languages other than English (or, coincidentally, German), when the permalink was not actually labelled "permalink". Fixed, now!
