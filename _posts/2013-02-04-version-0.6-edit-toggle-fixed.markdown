title: Version 0.6 Edit Toggle Fixed
---
Just wanted to let you all know that the Uneddit Reddit extension has just hit version 0.6. You can get it in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uneddit-reddit/akibhpdlinfcelalimeibjcdolmfifel) or if you already have it installed, through your Extensions page (hit Update Extensions Now).

This version fixes the issue with being unable to toggle edit links when they're not found by UnedditReddit.
