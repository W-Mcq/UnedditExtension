Chrome Extension for Uneddit Reddit

This extension is pretty simple, as it just grabs the undeleted comments from UnedditReddit.com and then replaces them inline with Reddit.

The project consists of:

1. `manifest.json` - Basic manifest file for Chrome
2. `uneddit.js` - The content script that does all of the work of the extension
3. `jquery-1.8.3.min.js` - jQuery 1.8.3
4. `snuownd.js` - SnuOwnd, the Reddit markdown javascript
5. `icon*.png` - Icons
